# Case Study- Helium Systems Inc: People-Powered Networks

## <u> Overview and Origin </u>

 Helium is an Internet-of-Things developer platform for building networks and transferring IoT device data. The platform is famous for building peer-to-peer weireless network that simplify connectivity to the internet and becoming a network operator. Helium devices provide wireless coverage where it's users can earn cryptocurrency tokens known as Helium from their living rooms

 The company was founded in July 1, 2013 by: 
 <li>Amir Halem- co-founder, chairman, and the current CEO of Helium</li>
 <li> Shawn Fanning- Founder of Napster, Snocap, and Rupture
 <li> and Sean Carey- Ex-CTO of Helium.</li>
<br>

 Amir Halem, the current CEO finished his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Artificial Intelligence in 1999. He worked at DICE, a project from Electronic Arts as Lead Game Designer, then became a director and a co-founder at other start-ups before starting his venture with Helium Systems Inc. Sean Carey was on the team as the CTO for 2 years before founding other companies and then getting into the space of venture capital, working at Tiger Global Management and VSC Ventures. Shawn Fanning, famously depicted as Justin Timberlake in the movie 'The Social Network' was a founder at a successful music company, Napster, then went on to work on different projects including Facebook and Helium, to now work at Rupture under Electronic Arts. 

  Helium is currently a Series D company, announcing their most recent round in Febraury 19, 2022. The company has been funded by well known venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management, Kholsa Ventures, and Union Square Ventures. Total publicly filed funding the company has received accumulates to $364.8M in their 7 funding rounds. 

 The company started its roots as a regular wireless network company, established to provide low-cost, low-power, low-bandwidth sensors that make connectivity a lot simipler between devices. The sensors can be seen today in millions of devices such as thermostats, fire alarms, and kitchen appliances. They wanted to use these sensors on wireless modems and other IoT devices to enable more connectivity. They called this technology LongFi sensors to be used by Helium Hotspots, where users can receive compensation through Proof of Coverage, which we will dive deeper into within the next section.

 ## <u> Business Activities </u>

 Helium is currently trying to make telecommunication more affordable for the everyday consumer. The platform is built to provide peer-to-peer wireless networks that is secure and cost-effective for low-powered Internet of Things devices. A consumer can buy a helium device and provide a hotspot that connects devices to the particular hotspot for 5G-like internet usage. The financial component within this is very interesting as users who have Helium devices or Hotspots, can earn HNT tokens for the services they provide. Currently there are 975.5K hotspots across the globe and the HNT token itself has a market cap of $333.53M with a market price of $2.50 as depicted in the picture below. Helium devices are quite popular across Southern China, North America, and Western Europe.

 Plugging in a helium device to a network enables its users to receive compensation through Helium's proof of coverage model. Users get connected to the internet using the device's LongFi connectivity which is essentially WiFi but with a much larger radius of connectivity, longer than WiFi and even cellular networks. Helium devices currently are not intended to replace the WiFi within user's houses but instead provide connectivity to IoT devices that only require small bits of information. The more IoT devices that pick up the Helium device's network, the more HNT a user makes from their device. The technologies that work in collaboration with helium include LoRaWAN, which are included in IoT devices such as GPS trackers, environmental sensors, weather meters, etc. The company uses Python, Java, C++, Rust, Ruby, PowerShell, Elixir, Lua, Haskell, and other applications to build and maintain Helium and the HNT network. The HNT token is listed as an ERC-20 token under ethereum's blockchain and uses smart contracts to execute rewards and peer-to-peer connectivity. 

 Helium's platform is fairly unique and innovative which is what gives them the edge over their competitors. A lot of their competitors are indirect competitors which include major telecommunication companies such AT&T and Verizon, but their are other protocols that utilize the blockchain and peer-to-peer connectivity for IoT devices such as MXC.org, SigFox, Mapmetrics. Due to the high volumes of peer-to-peer connectivity with Helium, the costs for Helium devices and mining are much more affordable than their competition. ----
