# Case Study- Helium Systems Inc: People-Powered Networks

## <u> Overview and Origin </u>

 [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is an Internet-of-Things developer platform for building networks and transferring IoT device data. The platform is famous for building peer-to-peer weireless network that simplify connectivity to the internet and becoming a network operator. Helium devices provide wireless coverage where it's users can earn cryptocurrency tokens known as Helium from their living rooms. A simple explanation on the Helium platform can be explained by <i><b> clicking on the image below</i></b>.

 The company was founded in July 1, 2013 by: 
 <li>Amir Halem- co-founder, chairman, and the current CEO of Helium</li>
 <li> Shawn Fanning- Founder of Napster, Snocap, and Rupture
 <li> and Sean Carey- Ex-CTO of Helium.</li>
<br>

 Amir Halem, the current CEO finished his Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Artificial Intelligence in 1999. He worked at DICE, a project from Electronic Arts as Lead Game Designer, then became a director and a co-founder at other start-ups before starting his venture with Helium Systems Inc. Sean Carey was on the team as the CTO for 2 years before founding other companies and then getting into the space of venture capital, working at Tiger Global Management and VSC Ventures. Shawn Fanning, famously depicted as Justin Timberlake in the movie 'The Social Network' was a founder at a successful music company, Napster, then went on to work on different projects including Facebook and Helium, to now work at Rupture under Electronic Arts. 

  Helium is currently a Series D company, announcing their most recent round in Febraury 19, 2022. The company has been funded by well known venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management, Kholsa Ventures, and Union Square Ventures. Total publicly filed funding the company has received accumulates to $364.8M in their 7 funding rounds. 

 The company started its roots as a regular wireless network company, established to provide low-cost, low-power, low-bandwidth sensors that make connectivity a lot simipler between devices. The sensors can be seen today in millions of devices such as thermostats, fire alarms, and kitchen appliances. They wanted to use these sensors on wireless modems and other IoT devices to enable more connectivity. They called this technology LongFi sensors to be used by Helium Hotspots, where users can receive compensation through Proof of Coverage, which we will dive deeper into within the next section.

 ## <u> Business Activities </u>

 Helium is currently trying to make telecommunication more affordable for the everyday consumer. The platform is built to provide peer-to-peer wireless networks that is secure and cost-effective for low-powered Internet of Things devices. A consumer can buy a helium device and provide a hotspot that connects devices to the particular hotspot for 5G-like internet usage. The financial component within this is very interesting as users who have Helium devices or Hotspots, can earn HNT tokens for the services they provide. Currently there are 975.5K hotspots across the globe and the HNT token itself has a market cap of $333.53M with a market price of $2.50 as depicted in the picture below. Helium devices are quite popular across Southern China, North America, and Western Europe.

 Plugging in a helium device to a network enables its users to receive compensation through Helium's proof of coverage model. Users get connected to the internet using the device's LongFi connectivity which is essentially WiFi but with a much larger radius of connectivity, longer than WiFi and even cellular networks. Helium devices currently are not intended to replace the WiFi within user's houses but instead provide connectivity to IoT devices that only require small bits of information. The more IoT devices that pick up the Helium device's network, the more HNT a user makes from their device. The technologies that work in collaboration with helium include LoRaWAN, which are included in IoT devices such as GPS trackers, environmental sensors, weather meters, etc. The company uses Python, Java, C++, Rust, Ruby, PowerShell, Elixir, Lua, Haskell, and other applications to build and maintain Helium and the HNT network. The HNT token is listed as an ERC-20 token under ethereum's blockchain and uses smart contracts to execute rewards and peer-to-peer connectivity. 

 Helium's platform is fairly unique and innovative which is what gives them the edge over their competitors. A lot of their competitors are indirect competitors which include major telecommunication companies such AT&T and Verizon, but their are other protocols that utilize the blockchain and peer-to-peer connectivity for IoT devices such as [MXC Foundation](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner), [SigFox](https://www.sigfox.com/en), and [NitroNetwork](https://nitro.network/). Due to the high volumes of peer-to-peer connectivity with Helium, the costs for Helium devices and mining are much more affordable than their competition. The peer-to-peer connectivity is also an approach that disrupts the traditional telecommunication industry. The company predicts that half of the 5G acitivity within the next 10 years will be peer-to-peer while the other half would be provided by traditional telecommunication companies. This is definitely a challenge as most telecommunication companies accross the globe are government-backed or operate in an oligopoly/monopoly making the industry challenging to penetrate. Currently, Helium does not have the technology and resources to compete with traditional telecommunication companies. Competing against them requires a lot of infrastructure which is difficult to obtain as a company. But a majority of telecommunication companies operate out of their home country which Helium has the advantage over as they have a substantial global presence.

 ## <u> Landscape </u>

 The company as mentioned earlier is in the telecommunication industry but with an innovate approach by using the blockchain to enable peer-to-peer connectivity through their proof of coverage model. The telecommunication industry has had a couple of innovations in the past including the likes of 5G Network & Technology which provides higher speeds than previously connected cellular broadbank networks at much lower latency. The telecommunication industry has also started using Artificial Intelligence in their business operations and to retrive important information from data gathered from IoT sensors and devices. The increasing number of IoT devices also provide a need for telecommunication companies to increase expenditure and resources to build out infrastructure/computing power to support such devices. The COVID-19 pandemic offered many opportunities to telecom companies to innovate within the space as global connectivity online through cloud computing, IoT devices, and artificial intelligence increased substantially, making space for newer startups to prosper within this space. Helium is also linked quite heavily as a blockchain protocol with its HNT token and peer-to-peer connectivity which is a space that although has been struggling these past couple quarter of 2022, has taken leaps and bounds since the company's inception in 2013, quite significantly in 2020 as well. With the rise of the Ethereum blockchain and the use of smart contracts within the blockchain to build out projects, Helium has taken advantage of such features to make their place within the network and increase their user base. The changed their model quite substantially since its inception as they were just going to utilize Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to build out a network of peer-to-peer connectivity with IoT devices. But the use of the blockchain provided the infrastructure to enable peer-to-peer connectivity effectively.
 
The telecommunication industry with companies such as AT&T and Verizon have not tapped into the blockchain to innovate their offerings but instead have been putting more emphasis on expanding their 5G connectivity and tapping onto less technologically adept industries such as the agricultural industry to innovate their offerings through technology. Other major companies within the blockchain that work with IoT devices and provide proof of coverage mining capabilities include the likes of [NitroNetwork](https://nitro.network/) and [MXC Foundation](https://matchx.io/pages/m2-pro-miner). Each of these companies have taken a different approach to build out peer-to-peer connectivity. MXC Foundation uses LPWAN (low-power wide-area network) over LoRaWAN networks which provide geolocation-based coverage to IoT devices around the world. While NitroNetworks and Helium use LoRaWAN which is currently the more popular technology for IoT device connectivity, LPWAN has been up-and-coming due to its higher range. LPWAN and LoRaWAN IoT devices have different use cases as LPWAN is faster but is unfit for frequent data transfer applications, and LoRaWAN has longer range but is not ideal for large data payloads. LoRaWAN is also more affordable as Helium hotspots range at about $300 while MXC's M2 Pro costs 10x it's price at $3000. Each of these protocols are also trying to innovate further in different directions to diversify their product offerings. MXC Foundation has tapped into the NFT space and NitroNetwork is building out staking and earning through their LP tokens within the blockchain. 

## <u> Results </u>

Helium has provided an innovative approach to the telecommunication industry which has not been seen in over couple decades. We have grown to know the same telecommunication companies in Oligopolies/Monopolies our entire lives but Helium is making strives to disrupt the industry further. Their current focus lies in building out peer-to-peer connectivity with IoT devices but are taping into the 5G space with newer operations as well. The company is approaching 1 million hotspot devices and is building out their 5G radio connectivity further, approaching a 8000 5G radio devices. They are backed by significant investors with the likes of Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management, Kholsa Ventures, and Union Square Ventures but have struggled to keep and maintain their core management team. The concern with the company might be internal as only one of the 3 co-founders remains in the company as of now. 

Their product offerings however, have been expanding further and further, with new users implementing Helium hotspots to earn HNT tokens and HNT supply increasing substantially. The approach to mining these tokens are not expensive either and require 0 GPUs which is prevalent in the proof of work model which requires a lot of energy. As Helium is a DAO, the protocol works to support the peers using the platform, who help enable the platform to be built further, as seen with their new operations in phase 2. Although it is difficult to find their metrics, it can be said the company is doing well as they are not pivoting away from their core operations but building more to utilize it even further. Compared to its competitors, Helium has much more users and more mining devices across the globe. They have major operations in China as well where it is very difficult for multinational companies, especially in the telecommunication space to penetrate within that market. with little to no limitations on using Helium devices within geographical location, the company is poised to succeed within the space.

One of the challenges that Helium will face as it continues to expand is the regulatory environment. Peer-to-peer connectivity has not been taken lightly by regulators across the globe and Helium will face a challenge within that space. Helium devices also have limitations with other telecommunication companies as some telecommunication companies prevent helium hotspots to be used with WiFi routers found in individual's homes as Helium networks disrupt the operations of major telecommunication companies. These companies have also tapped in the IoT and sensor space but the approach is centralized over the decentralized approach that Helium took, making Helium a competitor to them.

## <u> Recommendation </u>

 I would recommend Helium to tap into supporting other cryptocurrencies as the hotspot mines using LoRaWAN technology to provide HNT tokens. Yes, HNT tokens can be traded for other cryptocurrencies on other platforms but there are transaction fees such as gas fees to be paid on each trade. Providing users the option to mine other cryptocurrencies within the platform itself could make the device more popular and bring more individuals to the platform. With more miners in use and in circulation, more tokens are earned by users, hence making helium hotspots even more viable for the $300 investment that a user would make. This is something that competitor MXC has been utilizing within its product offering, making their product more popular within the space. Tapping into this would require Helium to have their token listed under different blockchain networks where primary cryptocurrencies are present or the company can hedge HRC tokens with other cryptocurrencies internally to provide these tokens to its peers. The company can also build more pool of assets with other cryptocurrencies that can be used for staking, and provide those rewards to the peers using their platform. The reason why these technologies would be appropriate in this case, as it provides ease of use to Helium's customers as most of Helium's customers either stake or trade their HNT tokens either way and to stake tokens on any blockchain network, you typically need an even split of 2 or more tokens. For example, if a user wanted to stake HNT tokens on a DAO exchange in a pool of HNT and ETH, they would be required to provide a 50/50 split of HNT and ETH within that pool. For this, they would need to purchase ETH to earn on their HNT tokens. If ETH was provided just through mining from a Helium Hotspot, the user would not need to purchase any ETH on their own, or pay any further transaction fees. This would make mining from a Helium Hotpsot a more profitable investment for peers.
